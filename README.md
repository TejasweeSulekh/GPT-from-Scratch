# GPT-from-Scratch
This repository contains the code for a project that I did during my winter break 2023. It was influenced by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&amp;list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ.

It contains Notebooks which implemented the following:
- MicroGrad - Created a interface which implements reverse gradient calculations and creates a graph to display the updated network.
- MakeMore - Creates a model which uses names.txt as the dataset to generate new names using different models.
- GPT from Scratch - These are files which uses multi-headed attention on the tiny shakespear dataset. which generates text similar to shakespear and compares the same with a model which uses bigram as the backbone of the model.
